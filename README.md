# Composer template for drunomics Drupal projects

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/drunomics/drupal-project.svg?branch=6.x)](https://www.travis-ci.org/drunomics/drupal-project)

Builds upon https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project.

## Version compatibility

| Git branch/tag: | Drupal core: |
|---              | ---          |
| 5.x             | Drupal 8     |
| 6.x             | Drupal 9     |

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
// Last stable version:
composer create-project drunomics/drupal-project:6.* PROJECT
// Last development version:
composer create-project drunomics/drupal-project:6.*@dev --stability dev PROJECT
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your
installation.

```
cd PROJECT
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## Documentation overview

The template builds upon [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).
Please follow the README of https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project
for general documentation.

## Optional features

Some optional features can be enabled by setting some environment variables
when creating the project. To set a variable, you can set the variable when
invoking composer; e.g.:

    VARIABLE=1 composer create-project drunomics/drupal-project PROJECT

The following variables are supported:

| Variable | Description | Default | Possible values |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| PROJECT_ADD_DEVSETUP_DOCKER          | Whether the docker-devsetup should be added. | 1 | "1" or "0" |
| PROJECT_ADD_DEVSETUP_DRUNOMICS       | Whether the drunomics devsetup extensions should be added. | unset | "1" or unset |

## Default variables

Environment variables that can be configured project-wide are managed in
`.defaults.env`. Refer to the prepared variables in the file for environment
variables tha are already supported in the template.
